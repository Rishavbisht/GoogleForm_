# Google Forms  using Node.js, MongoDB, and React

This project is a clone of the Google Forms application where users can create custom forms, submit responses, and view the submitted data. It is built using a **MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js)**.

## Features:

- **Form Creation**: Users can create dynamic forms by adding multiple fields such as title, name.
- **Form Submission**: Once the form is created, users can fill out the form and submit their responses.
- **Form Data Storage**: The form data is stored in **MongoDB**, allowing easy access and management.
- **Backend API**: A RESTful API built using **Express.js** for form creation, submission, and retrieval.
- **Frontend UI**: A clean and simple user interface built using **React** that allows users to easily interact with the form and submit responses.

## Technologies Used:

- **Frontend**:
  - React.js
  - Axios (for API calls)
  - HTML/CSS

- **Backend**:
  - Node.js
  - Express.js
  - MongoDB (for storing form data)

## How to Run:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/google-form-clone.git

- **Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies**:
  - cd google-form-clone
